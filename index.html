            <h3>A Quick Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Hello! I am Aleisha Peterson, and this is my digital home. This site is designed to be a showcase for my journey in web development, focusing on the fundamentals of structured, accessible content through clean HTML. I believe that a strong foundation starts with well-documented and semantic code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you will find information about my background, the projects I am currently working on, and how you can get in touch with me. I am currently focused on mastering HTML structure before moving on to styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript.
            </p>
